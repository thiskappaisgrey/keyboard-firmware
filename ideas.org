* Ideas for this project
** TODO Write a scripting language that runs on the raspbery pi pico
** TODO Be able to add actions that can be added when a key is pressed in an FRP style
- For example, on a "doublepress" (keys pressed twice with a certain threshold) do something, on a "longpress" do something else.
- Compose keymaps / layers together.
